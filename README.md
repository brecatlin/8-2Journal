The Gaming Room has requested assistance in creating a web-based game Draw It or Lose IT. Draw It or Lose It is a four round game where teams must guess what is being sketched in under a minute. The Gaming Room has requested great abilities within the game. To begin this request, I had to create and produce distinctive identifiers for each instance of player, team, and game. 
When developing this the documentation, I really enjoyed how there was a provided outline to help guide me when creating and developing the code. The UML diagram really helped with the coding process. 
Looking back on the documents, the one submission I would revise was my project 2 submission. I wish I would have done more research on the developmental tools for MAC, Linux, and Windows. 
When considering the users need in developmenting a game, its important to make the software "easy to use". This way it would attract the users to continue to play the game. 
Before this course, I have never designed any software. I will use different techniques such as developing a video preview of the game. I would then present the video to my client in my software design.
